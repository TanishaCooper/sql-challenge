# Employee Database: Historical Data Analysis

## Description
As a new data scientist, the challenge was a research project on Pewlett Hackard employees from the 19802 and 1990s using SQL: data modeling, data engineering, and data anlysis. The challenge utlizized data modeling, engineering, and analysis to build a SQL database with six tables. Using employee data from historical csv files, the database and tables were sucessfully imported.

## Data Engineering Process
 - Inspect CSV files
 - Design an ERD of the tables using QuickDBD
 - Export foundational Postgresql query from QuickDBD
 - Modify postgresql query to best align data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other query contraints. 
 -- Identified composite keys, if primary key was not unique to table. Review table: dept_emp, dept_manager
 - Tables were created in the correct order to ensure table has correct foreign key
